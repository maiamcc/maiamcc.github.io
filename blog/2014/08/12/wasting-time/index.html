<div class="entry-content"><p>At Hacker School today, I didn&rsquo;t get all that much done, and in my day&rsquo;s worth of non-progress I brushed up against two distinct kinds of &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; time.</p>

<p>The first is somewhat productive, as wasted time goes. I spent most of the afternoon barking up various wrong trees as I tried to figure out how to structure the next step of my current project (a contradance database, which I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll blog about for real soon). Kind of like a real-life breadth-first search where every node takes several hours.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a way to structure my data, and now I want to be able to search and sort and filter a bunch of these data-bundles. First I assumed I&rsquo;d write the search code in Python and worry about making it web-app-y later. I started brainstorming and had <em>no idea</em> how I would optimize my code, and then someone suggested I use <a href="datatables.net">Data Tables</a> a JQuery plug-in which will search and sort data super fast. So I spent a while reading up on Data Tables, looking through FAQs and add-ons and trying to figure out if it would give me some of the more advanced searching functionality I wanted. Someone else then suggested that if I ultimately wanted to search by a giant table of data invisible to the user, why don&rsquo;t I just use mySQL and go right to the database end of things? So I talked to Andrew and hashed out a vague plan and set up mySQL on my machine and found some nice-looking tutorials&hellip; only to have someone <em>else</em> point out that hey, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about learning SQL, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> can do all of that for you and you still get to write in Python. I gave Django a quick look, got excited, and then whoops it was 5:00.<!-- more --></p>

<p>So, frustratingly, I ended this saga with not a jot of code written, not a step of a tutorial progressed through. Not a pleasant feeling. But I console myself with the thought that my day was still <em>somewhat</em> productive, by some metrics. Unlike when I started, I know what I&rsquo;m doing next. Unlike when I started, I know a bit more about Data Tables (which I think I <em>will</em> end up using for the front end of my final product) and mySQL (which is a good thing for anyone working with databases to understand). And so even if I&rsquo;m right back at point A, I can move forward from here. I might call this sort of time-wasting <em>productive time-wasting</em>, or maybe <em>foundational time-wasting</em>, since, though it doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything itself, it lays a foundation for future accomplishment of things.</p>

<p>The second kind of time I wasted is harder to feel good about. It was <em>unproductive time-wasting</em> at its finest. I didn&rsquo;t even get a shaved yak out of it. By the time I gave up on the above because my brain was fried, I decided that I would spend an hour trying to get some dynamic content on my website and then head home around 6 (because I know that I don&rsquo;t do good work that late into the evening&mdash;better for me to leave earlier and <em>actually</em> not work, as opposed to pretending to work but accomplishing nothing).</p>

<p>I spent the next hour and a half poking around AJAX and history.js tutorials, still no closer to what I wanted. It&rsquo;s easy enough to make a link-click change the content of a div with AJAX, but what I really want is for the page URL to change as well, but without reloading the page (unless the user has a crappy browser that doesn&rsquo;t support AJAX), and for the page change to be accessible as history, forward- or back-able, etc. I figured out how to change a div with AJAX within the first 15 minutes, and the rest of that time was spent banging my head against history.js READMEs and tutorials and stack overflow topics.</p>

<p>Unlike that first chunk of wasted time, at the end of my dynamic content spree I felt no more knowledgeable than when I began, no better equipped to tackle the problem. All I felt was inadequate and impostor-y because I couldn&rsquo;t decipher any of the history.js walkthroughs or code examples.</p>

<p>So, lessons learned from all this: I want to start setting myself discrete chunks of time in which to do things. Not only will this make it easier to start on daunting projects<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and give my workflow more structure so that I&rsquo;m not jumping around all the time, it will (hopefully) keep me back from the edge of the black hole. After I&rsquo;ve spent an hour (especially late in the evening) on something like the dynamic content thing and a timer goes off on my computer, I have to step back and reevaluate. &ldquo;Am I getting stuff done? Is it time to ask for help? Is my brain too mushy to keep doing this? Is my current approach still working?&rdquo; Even if I do the same task for several hours straight, setting myself a little mental check-in every hour or every 45 minutes will, I hope, help keep me on track. Plus, I do much better with accountability when I have a concrete timeline. Yesterday I resolved that before lunch I would write a README for my <a href="https://github.com/maianess/markovgen">abandoned Markov generator</a> so that I could come back to it later, and I&rsquo;d go through a chapter of the <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html">Interactive Python Algorithms and Data Structures</a> course. I did both of those things, and I felt <em>so good</em> about doing all the things that I&rsquo;d said I was going to do!</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m curious how I will react to having more, smaller projects that I can work on in fits and starts, without oversaturating my brain with any one thing. I&rsquo;m thinking of giving this a try&mdash;maybe some of the coding exercises in the Interactive Python tutorial, maybe <a href="http://mathamy.com/pages/phonebook.html">Amy Hanlon&rsquo;s phonebook exercise</a>, or one of the mini-projects from the old HS <a href="https://hackpad.com/Iron-Forger-kEmauANGcV5">Ironforger</a> group. Something to put on the back-burners of my brain!</p>
