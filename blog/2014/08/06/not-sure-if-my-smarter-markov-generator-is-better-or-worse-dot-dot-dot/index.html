<div class="entry-content"><p>Some samples from a theoretically more intelligent Markov gen (which uses part-of-speech patterns randomly filled in from the text, rather than word patterns). Though honestly, this one seems a fair bit worse than the &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; one. I&rsquo;ll try phase two, which will combine the two approaches: filling in a part-of-speech skeleton using word patterns collected from the text. Anyway, here&rsquo;s some gobbledygook!</p>
