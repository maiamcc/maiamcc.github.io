<div class="entry-content"><p>For anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know, this past December I started an internship with <a href="//www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> as part of OPW, the <a href="//wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen">Outreach Program for Women</a>. The point of this program is to get more women (by which they really mean cis woman <em>and</em> trans folks <em>and</em> genderqueer/genderfluid/agender folks&hellip; so basically, people who aren&rsquo;t cis <strong><a href="//www.mandleco.com/Default.asp">MEN</a></strong>) involved in the FOSS world. In my particular case, it certainly succeeded! I&rsquo;d been meaning to do some open source contributing for a while, but had always been too intimidated and overwhelmed to start.<!--more--> When it came time for OPW applications, however, I <em>had</em> to: had to pick a project, delve into the codebase, and submit a preliminary bugfix for my <em>application</em>. Which, at least for me, was fabulous, because my very application process convinced me that FOSS contribution was something that I could do, and even something that I enjoyed!</p>

<p>So, here I am, one month into my three months of OPW. I&rsquo;ve been working on <a href="//wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Music">GNOME Music</a>, the new music player for GNOME, and specifically on implementing smart playlists (like Most Played, Recently Played, and maybe someday something as ambitious as Favorites).</p>

<p>In some ways, it feels like I&rsquo;ve done remarkably little work in a month. Part of this is because of timing&mdash;I started the internship, worked for a week at the very bottom of the steepest part of the learning curve getting very little done, then went off for a previously scheduled vacation, then holidays happened, then Vadim was away&hellip; so time-wise, the first few weeks were fragmented and disorganized. Also, I had to set up a development environment&mdash;installing Fedora 21, getting all my dependences in order, and getting GNOME Music to build properly&mdash;which is an experience akin to having teeth pulled, without drugs, while lying on a bed of needles and listening to the Numa Numa song on an endless loop. And I had to do that TWICE, because I started out on this adorable little computer lent to me by a friend which had only 1GB of RAM and I wanted to punch myself in the face whenever I tried to do anything, so I tried again on a much newer, nicer, faster machine. This whole dev. env. set-up took WAY more time than I had anticipated.</p>

<p>But also, it&rsquo;s disconcerting to be in the dark all over again, when I&rsquo;d just gotten used to feeling like I knew what was up. I had to learn a whole new (essentially docs- and comment-free) codebase, and a whole new language&mdash;<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a>, a query language that&rsquo;s super powerful but for some reason no one has written accessible tutorials or how-to&rsquo;s on the interwebs, so basically my only resource was the incredibly dense, not at all beginner-friendly <a href="//www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">technical specs</a>. Somehow, I didn&rsquo;t quite expect or remember how slowly work goes when you&rsquo;re just starting out, when you&rsquo;re just learning your tools.</p>

<p>However, recently, I&rsquo;ve started writing actual code. I feel like I have a handle (well, more of a handle, anyway) on how this program actually works, how to write in SPARQL, and the tools at my disposal for testing things. (I don&rsquo;t know how I could do any of this, for instance, if I couldn&rsquo;t tool around with querying my database directly from the command line with <code>tracker-sparql --query</code>.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also occurred to me that I&rsquo;ve been blogging remarkably little about this whole experience. Which is odd, because I actually do really enjoy writing blog posts, and generally jump at the opportunity to talk loudly into the internet, even if no one is listening. But somehow OPW feels different&mdash;more serious, more adult, less happy-fun-play-time&mdash;than Hacker School. At Hacker School I kept a blog mostly for myself, as a journal and archive, a sounding board for my own ideas and a check on myself that I actually understood [concept X], which I could tell by whether or not I could coherently explain it to someone else. Now that I&rsquo;m actually doing a Job (okay, Internship) in the Real World, somehow everything seems higher-stakes. I&rsquo;m now reluctant to post those messy &ldquo;why am I failing?&rdquo; blog posts, or get really excited about this cool new thing I learned but everyone else has known for years. I want my posts to demonstrate the Excellent Things I have done, and be insightful and ground-breaking. And I realize that I&rsquo;ve essentially been kicking my own blogging repeatedly in the shins.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m a month into OPW, finally out of holiday madness and ready to settle down into a consistent schedule. I&rsquo;m past the worst of the learning curve and have a pretty decent handle on SPARQL, the architecture of GNOME Music, and what needs to happen next in this project. I&rsquo;m going to revisit my <a href="/blog/2014/12/29/rules-for-opw/">Rules for Myself During OPW</a> so (hopefully) I can successfully work from home without accidentally shutting off my brain and spending the whole day staring at cat pictures because I&rsquo;m too dehydrated to work. I&rsquo;m going to document my code as I go, to make things easier on the next person who has to dive head-first into this codebase. And I&rsquo;m going to blog more, the impressiveness of said blog posts be damned. (Future posts I have in mind: &ldquo;What is SPARQL, Anyway?&rdquo;; &ldquo;How I Chose My First FOSS Project&rdquo;; &ldquo;How to (Start) Figur(ing) Out an Alien Codebase&rdquo;; &ldquo;How Does GNOME Music Work?&rdquo;) And mostly, I&rsquo;m gonna spend the next two months writing some cool code! I encourage you to do the same! (And if you want to contribute to GNOME Music, I am MORE than happy to explain how everything works!)</p>
