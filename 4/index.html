    My name is Maia. I&#8217;m a programmer based in New York City, currently working as a software engineer at <a href="//www.shopspring.com/">Spring</a>. This is where I (somewhat infrequently) chronicle my journeys through code, as well as other vaguely related adventures.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had this grand, exciting plan. A normal Markov generator trains on a corpus of text, and sees what words are likely to come after other words. So for example, given &ldquo;Happy families are all alike,&rdquo; it would say, &ldquo;Happy families&rdquo; &mdash;> &ldquo;are&rdquo;, &ldquo;families are&rdquo; &mdash;> &ldquo;all&rdquo;, &ldquo;are all&rdquo; &mdash;> &ldquo;alike&rdquo;. You can then start with any random seed and populate a whole chunk of however much text you please by going through your correspondence and picking at random: &ldquo;hmm, what words might possibly come after &lsquo;are all&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was going to take it one step further and incorporate part-of-speech tagging. The above example sentence would be part-of-speech tagged, &ldquo;adjective/plural noun/verb non-3rd person singular present/determiner/adverb.&rdquo; Then I could make a correspondence: adjective + plural noun may be followed by a non-3rd person singular present verb, and so on. And when I had a whole paragraph or two worth of &ldquo;adjective noun verb&rdquo; etc. I could begin to fill that in from my word correspondence: &ldquo;What word might come after &lsquo;families are&rsquo; that is also a noun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was brilliant! I was excited! And, as you&rsquo;ve probably guessed, things didn&rsquo;t turn out the way I had planned. I didn&rsquo;t quite consider that one of my correspondences was much more general than the other, so is I generated my parts-of-speech beforehand and then went looking for a word that can follow words a + b and is also a (fill in part of speech here), I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily find anything! And then I&rsquo;m reduced to filling in a random (part of speech), which leaves me no better off than a normal Markov generator, and perhaps even worse (see my last two posts for comparison).</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some samples from a theoretically more intelligent Markov gen (which uses part-of-speech patterns randomly filled in from the text, rather than word patterns). Though honestly, this one seems a fair bit worse than the &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; one. I&rsquo;ll try phase two, which will combine the two approaches: filling in a part-of-speech skeleton using word patterns collected from the text. Anyway, here&rsquo;s some gobbledygook!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m baaaack! Miss me? Well, if you didn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s okay, because I&rsquo;m not even sure who you are or why you&rsquo;re reading this. But if you are reading this and you did miss me, well, then, great!</p>

<p>Nearing the end of week 2 of Hacker School. I really did mean to blog much more regularly, but then I installed Mavericks (unintentionally locking myself out of my computer for an hour) and it borked my Octopress/Ruby set-up, and then I didn&rsquo;t manage to get it all working again until just now.</p>

<p>ANYWAY. So I wrote a thing in Python! I made a <a href="github.com/maianess/studentchooser">Student Chooser</a> that runs out of command line and will pick  a student at random from a given roster of students, with decreasing likelihood according to how many times that student has been picked already. It also lets you keep track of who is absent and move between multiple rosters (i.e. multiple classes). It&rsquo;s dorktastic and clocks in at 500 lines, and I can&rsquo;t tell if that&rsquo;s because it actually needed to be 500 lines long or because it&rsquo;s inefficient coding. But it&rsquo;s done, and it&rsquo;s my first completed piece of code in Python, and it was super enlightening to write! Really got the basics of Python (syntax, loops, some of the common list/string/dict. operators, etc.) under my fingers, plus some reading/writing file stuff.</div>
