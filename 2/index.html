  <div class="entry-content"><p>Congratulations, you&rsquo;ve made it through Git 101 (<code>init</code>, <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>status</code>) and its slightly more difficult companion course, Git 201 (<code>branch</code>, <code>checkout</code>, <code>pull</code>).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Are you ready to pull out the big guns? Here are a handful of commands I&rsquo;ve been using lately, which I will now write about on the off-chance that they&rsquo;re useful to someone else. Welcome to Git 301.</p>

<h4>Selective Checkouts with <code>checkout -p</code></h4>

<p>Okay, this isn&rsquo;t really changing history. But it IS a fancy bit of next-level gittery that I&rsquo;ve found useful as I try to make my git history useful to others and actually move in a logical feature-by-feature progression, instead of reflecting my all-over-the-place, distracted workflow.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know, this past December I started an internship with <a href="//www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> as part of OPW, the <a href="//wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen">Outreach Program for Women</a>. The point of this program is to get more women (by which they really mean cis woman <em>and</em> trans folks <em>and</em> genderqueer/genderfluid/agender folks&hellip; so basically, people who aren&rsquo;t cis <strong><a href="//www.mandleco.com/Default.asp">MEN</a></strong>) involved in the FOSS world. In my particular case, it certainly succeeded! I&rsquo;d been meaning to do some open source contributing for a while, but had always been too intimidated and overwhelmed to start.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Achievement unlocked: accessing a USB disk via terminal!</p>

<p>Accessing a flash drive from terminal seems like it ought to be simple, but it&rsquo;s varying degrees of a pain on different OS&rsquo;s. It also seems like something I should have learned ages ago&ndash;especially considering that when I first started terminal-ing, <a href="//akaptur.com/">Allison Kaptur</a>&rsquo;s advice to me was to quit Finder cold-turkey until I could do everything I wanted to do via terminal. Anyway, for anyone who&rsquo;s a little confused by this, it&rsquo;s actually pretty easy.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in mid-July, I started at Hacker School, wide-eyed and green and totally freaked out. With only a little bit of Javascript under my belt (and a basically negligible amount of Java, so we&rsquo;re not even counting that), I decided to teach myself Python, slogged halfway through Zed Shaw&rsquo;s <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em>, then went off to go build something, because I work best by getting my hands dirty. For my first Python project, I wrote <a href="//github.com/maiamcc/studentchooser">studentchooser</a>, a little command-line app requested by a teacher friend of mine, who wanted a fair way to call on her students at random (for putting homework problems on the board, etc.). The idea was that, once a student had been selected, it was <em>less</em> likely that they would be selected again, but not impossible&mdash;the chance of them being picked subsequently would go down, but they would still be in the running.</p>

<p>So, I made a program to do that! You store a list of students for a given class period in what I called the <code>roster</code> (just a dictionary of students). Each <code>Student</code> object keeps track of the number of times it has been selected and its probability of being selected in the next round, as well as whether or not the student is absent.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> It took me a little more than a week to finish, as I was still muddling through Python as I went, and at the end, I had a working final product! A rough one, but a working one! And then I went off on my merry way, doing more and varied projects and slowly building up my Python chops, getting code review, etc. Somewhere along the way, so gradually I didn&rsquo;t even realize it, I began to feel competent, like with enough time to think and maybe a little Googling, I could Python my way out of most problems that were thrown at me. And so today, back at Hacker School for Alumni Thursday and itching to write some code (because I&rsquo;ve been up to my neck in web work for the past few weeks), I opted for a blast from the past, and dived into my very first Python project to poke around, refactor, clean up, and chronicle what I found and what I had learned in the past four months. Here are some findings, accomplishments, and reflections.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(If you&rsquo;re confused, see <a href="/blog/2014/10/23/markov-madness/">my previous post on my Markov generator adventures</a>.)</p>

<p>The other thing I got up to today was implementing some sort of (questionable) part-of-speech-based intelligence. The idea was to have a dictionary for parts of speech, in addition to a dictionary of words. Then the work flow would go something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>start with a random seed</li>
<li>what part of speech should come next? Given the POS&rsquo;s we already have, pick at random one that might follow it.</li>
<li>given the words we have, pick a word that might follow <em>of the correct part of speech</em>. If none exists, repeat from step 2.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, using word trigrams and POS trigrams, the above process doesn&rsquo;t really add much beyond what using plain &lsquo;ol word trigrams gets you. Could I make something better, though, by using, say, 4-grams or 5-grams of parts of speech?</div>

<h3>Part 1: Setting up the environment</h3>

<p>Setting up your environment is <em>awful</em>. You think, &ldquo;how long can it take to set up a virtual machine and install this software?&rdquo; The answer? <em>Longer than you could ever imagine.</em> Especially if your project is on a platform you&rsquo;re not familiar with, ask for advice early and often&mdash;because inevitably, something will go wrong and you&rsquo;ll need to ask someone wiser for help anyway, and you might as well not a bunch of junk to undo by the time you do. (Like when I tried to install VirtualBox Guest Additions and it destroyed by VM&rsquo;s video driver, and in fact all video drivers on any VMs I later installed. I had to wipe VirtualBox and start over. No fun.)</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent a ton of my time at Hacker School learning how to ask questions (or, to put a finer point on it, learning how to <em>not know things</em> and admit to others that I don&rsquo;t know things). The main reason that HS was so hard at first was that I wasn&rsquo;t good at asking questions, at admitting when I didn&rsquo;t know things, at letting myself (I feared) appear &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; in front of others. I was still better than some folks at pushing through this, but I wasn&rsquo;t as good as I would have liked. (This is all tied into impostor syndrome, of course.)</p>

<p>I got vastly better at this skill as I spent more time at Hacker School. I grew more comfortable in the environment, I gained trust in the folks around me and in my own abilities, and I came to believe that my asking questions, even ones about really basic (quote-unquote-&ldquo;basic&rdquo;) things, was a display of intelligence rather than a display of ignorance.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t realize about my shiny new skill of &ldquo;Admitting When I Don&rsquo;t Know Something and Asking Questions&rdquo; was how context-dependent it is. At Hacker School, in person or on Zulip, I feel totally comfortable asking questions about &ldquo;simple&rdquo; things, and admitting that I&rsquo;m totally in over my head with, say, troubleshooting my Virtual Machine installation and would someone please help me, and what is actually the difference between GET and POST because I never really learned it&hellip; that sort of thing. But as I prepare my application for the coming round of <a href="https://opw.gnome.org">OPW</a> and dive head-first into IRC chats about programs and programming styles I&rsquo;ve never used before, that all seem to require strange dependencies or have to be run on X virtual machine with Y stuff built on it, I recognize a feeling from my early days of Hacker School.</div>
