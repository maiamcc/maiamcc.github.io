Well, <a href="https://tilt.dev/">Team Tilt</a> will be there with bells on! ‚Ä¶But I myself, unfortunately, will not. Which is a particular shame, because I studied in Amsterdam for a semester in undergrad, and would love to go back! In lieu of that, I‚Äôve written up a bunch of stuff I‚Äôd do if I went, and that I want my coworkers to do in my stead. Thought I‚Äôd post it here for the whole internet to see‚Äîif you want to have some fun in Amsterdam on my behalf, then please please do so! (And if anyone wants to bring me back some cheese or hagelslag, well, I wouldn‚Äôt complain üòã ).</p>

<p>To all of y‚Äôall going to Kubecon (or just touristing around Amsterdam): <em>veilige reizen, en veel plezier</em>!</p>

<p>At the end of April, Windmill (all five of us) trekked down to GothamGo to learn things, meet people, and pitch our product. As Silver Level sponsors, we had our very own little table on the first floor; it was the perfect chance to pitch our fledgling product, make connections, and figure out what developers might want from us. The only question was: how?</p>

<p>We‚Äôre a brand-new team, and GothamGo was a great excuse to do some important work. In preparation for the conference, we talked, we brainstormed, we aligned on our values and objectives and product goals; and then took the results of those conversations and ran with them, building our booth and our pitch from the bottom up.</p>

<h2 id="the-booth-objectives-and-values">The Booth (Objectives and Values)</h2>

<p>The first order of business was: <em>what was our booth going to look like</em>? We asked this question of the team, and immediately realized that we first had to tackle our zeroth order of business: <em>what were our <strong>objectives</strong> for the conference</em>? In other words, what did we as a company hope to get out of GothamGo? Our answers would shape how we interacted with attendees, and how we decked out our booth to encourage those interactions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Life update time! After three great years at <a href="https://engineering.shopspring.com/">Spring</a>, I‚Äôm moving on to my next adventure; in April, I‚Äôll be joining <a href="https://windmill.engineering/">Windmill</a> as their fifth engineer, where I‚Äôll be building cloud-based developer tools, as well as company culture.</p>

<p>The most frequent question I‚Äôve got from people upon telling them this news (after ‚Äúwhat the heck is Windmill?!‚Äù) is, ‚ÄúHow did you prepare for your interviews?‚Äù (And all the related questions: ‚ÄúHow long did you prep for?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat were your on-sites like?‚Äù, etc.)</p>

<p>This post aims to answer those questions. Here‚Äôs some detail on my own personal interview prep and interview process. Of course, everything here should be taken with a grain of salt, as all of this will vary widely based on you and your skills, the sorts of companies you‚Äôre interviewing for, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Decorators are callables called on callables that return a callable which then replaces the original callable.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a blog post about interfaces in Go. I wanted to write about a headscratcher that cost me several hours of work when I first started learning Go, and I figured I might as well start from the beginning and write the article on interfaces that I wish I had read back then. The story of my encounter with nil interfaces is coming soon, but for now, here‚Äôs a brief and hopefully accessible piece on interfaces in Go.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> So, without further ado, I give you‚Ä¶</p>

<h3 id="what-is-an-interface">What Is an Interface?</h3>

<p>Coming from the dynamically-typed wild west of Python, one of the bits of Go that took the most getting used to was the idea of <em>interfaces</em>. An interface is a way of typing things according to their methods. If I want a function that can take any number of different types, so long as they have a given method (or two, or five) in common, I‚Äôll want to use an interface to accomplish this (since I can‚Äôt pass in any old thing because of Go‚Äôs type safety rules). To give a concrete example, say I‚Äôve got these classes: </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came out of school with a BA in music, tripped and fell, and landed in the tech world. The folks at Spring took a chance on me as an extremely junior developer and offered me a job. I‚Äôve been here now for a little more than two months, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Going into my first day at Spring (which also happened to be my first day as a software engineer, full stop), I was understandably pretty nervous. But I was also excited for what lay ahead, and Spring has done a fabulous job of easing me into my new life here. Here are some reflections on that first month (posted, er, somewhat belatedly), to give you an idea of what it‚Äôs like to be a new junior engineer at Spring.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Truthiness in Python is occasionally confusing. Obviously, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code> is false and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> is true, but beyond that, what then?</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code> is always false‚Äìthough this doesn‚Äôt mean that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False == None</code>, which is a mistake I made early in my Python career. I was confused by how a nonexistant list and an empty list were both falsey, and somewhere in my mind I thought that they were both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code> as well. Not so much.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Three months later, I‚Äôm done with my OPW internship with GNOME Music.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve learned that open-source contributing isn‚Äôt as scary and impossible as it once seemed, and that IRC is full of nice people who are happy to help! But I‚Äôve also learned that diving into a new codebase is challenging, at best, and nearly impossible at worst. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdb</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for x in dir(foo): print(x)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traceback.print_stack()</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inspect.getargspec(myfunc)</code> have become good friends of mine in the past three months. Good documentation, it turns out, is essential‚Äîthe project I was working on had very little, and the libraries it utilized (at least, the Python wrappers for those libraries) were similarly sketchily documented, and all this made learning the code waaaaay tougher than it needed to be.</div>
